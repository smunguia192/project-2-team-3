# project-2-team-3

# Group project
This is a group project. You should work in groups of 2 to 4 (not alone and not more than 4). If this is a problem, please let me know ahead of time.

# Requirements
For simplicity, I will use the term script in describing the project. But you can have multiple scripts, or one or more Jupyter Notebooks.

The following are required elements of the final script that is turned in:

* The script should use a sqlite database.
You can use the world.sqlite or other database we have used in class, download database, or make your own as part of the script.
Remember that we are working with sqlite, and we don't need huge databases for our purposes
The database should have at least two tables and a foreign key.
You must define and use at least two functions
I suggest using SQLAlchemy, though it is not required
You must have at least one JOIN
What to do
You may choose one of the following for what your script does as long as it meets the above criteria.

Write a script to query the world.sqlite for some data of interest, or to update the database with more recent data.
Write scripts to work with any of the following databases:
NorthwindLinks to an external site.: a small business database for tracking customers, orders, inventory, etc.
ChinookLinks to an external site.: a digital media library (iTunes) database
Kaggle is also a good source, particularly if you search for sqliteLinks to an external site..
Any other database you want to use or make is also fine.
